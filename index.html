<a name="the-problem" class="anchor" href="#the-problem"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>The Problem</h2>

<p>Those of us with some type of diabetes (whether type 1, type 2, or
monogenic) take on the task of either partially or fully simulating the
functioning of a biologically normal person's pancreas. In short, we
become our own pancreases. The tools we have to do this today - analog
insulins, home blood glucose monitors, insulin pumps, and continuous
blood glucose monitors - are much, much better than the tools that were
available to persons with diabetes (PWDs) even a generation ago.</p>

<p>But unfortunately, the tools at our disposal for managing the data that
is associated with these devices and technologies are very poor indeed.
Some are not available to everyone (the software for the Dexcom
continuous glucose monitor only runs on the Windows operating system);
some are fiendishly difficult to operate (uploading data from an
Animas/OneTouch Ping insulin pump into the Animas ezManager software via
the late-1990s-technology of an <em>infrared</em> syncing cable is a trial in
infinite patience; this is not to mention that despite supposed
compatibility, I have not <em>ever</em> succeeded in getting the Animas
ezManager software to sync with the pump successfully on my iMac running
OS X 10.7 Lion or 10.8 Mountain Lion); many devices and applications keep the data they produce locked away in
proprietary formats or only offer exporting of data in formats
inconvenient or downright useless (e.g., XML) for the average user.</p>

<p>In recent years since the introduction of the iPhone and the rising to
dominance of the smart phone paradigm in the cell phone marketplace, a
whole host of "logbook" applications have been developed ostensibly to
make the management of diabetes-related data easier. However, nearly
all - if not all (I speak from the position of having casually but not
thoroughly surveyed the landscape) - of these applications continue to
require a PWD to manually enter the data s/he wants to track. Given the
fact that except on the most very basic of blood glucose meters, every
test performed on a blood glucose meter is stored in memory, this
strikes me as a completely unnecessary replication of effort. The act of
performing a blood glucose test is itself an act of record-making; to
require that the PWD take the extra step of entering the result of this
test into a data-tracking application is <em>silly</em> and <em>wasteful</em>. The
same goes for insulin doses and carbohydrate counts, at least where insulin pumps with "Bolus Wizard"-type functionality are involved.</p>

<h2>
<a name="my-solution" class="anchor" href="#my-solution"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>My Solution</h2>

<p>All of this is an introduction to the tools I'm developing in this
repository. The tools here all rely on the export formats that <em>are</em>
available from various diabetes devices. (At the moment, of course, this
is limited to the devices I personally use.) My goal is to create
software tools that will be truly cross-platform, freely available (and
open source), and easy to use. The goal of these tools is to integrate
data regarding all aspects of life that affect diabetes (including
meals, carbohydrate counts, exercise, sleep, etc., as well as blood
glucose readings and insulin doses) and present that data in engaging,
informative, and in appropriate cases interactive visualizations.</p>

<p>If you would like to be involved in testing these software tools, you
may contact me via e-mail. Be aware that in their present state, the
tools I've developed are <strong>not yet user-friendly</strong>: you need to be
familiar with the command line in order to use these tools.</p>

<p>The software tools in this repository are provided as aids for
extracting data from files exported from the software that comes with
certain diabetes-related medical devices (namely, continuous glucose
monitors and insulin pumps) and visualizing that data. None of the tools
in this repository is intended to substitute for professional medical
advice regarding your diabetes care. Consult with your health care
