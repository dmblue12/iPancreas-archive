## About This Branch

This branch contains the code for a desktop app packaging together my Python scripts for processing and manipulating data from files exported from the software accompanying various diabetes devices (so far: just Dexcom continuous glucose monitors) along with JavaScript-based visualizations of the resulting JSON data.

The app is built with [TideSDK](http://www.tidesdk.org/ "TideSDK Homepage").
