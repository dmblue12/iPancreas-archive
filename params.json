{"name":"iPancreas","tagline":"Tools for visualizing and interfacing with diabetes-related data.","body":"## The Problem\r\n\r\nThose of us with some type of diabetes (whether type 1, type 2, or\r\nmonogenic) take on the task of either partially or fully simulating the\r\nfunctioning of a biologically normal person's pancreas. In short, we\r\nbecome our own pancreases. The tools we have to do this today - analog\r\ninsulins, home blood glucose monitors, insulin pumps, and continuous\r\nblood glucose monitors - are much, much better than the tools that were\r\navailable to persons with diabetes (PWDs) even a generation ago.\r\n\r\nBut unfortunately, the tools at our disposal for managing the data that\r\nis associated with these devices and technologies are very poor indeed.\r\nSome are not available to everyone (the software for the Dexcom\r\ncontinuous glucose monitor only runs on the Windows operating system);\r\nsome are fiendishly difficult to operate (uploading data from an\r\nAnimas/OneTouch Ping insulin pump into the Animas ezManager software via\r\nthe late-1990s-technology of an *infrared* syncing cable is a trial in\r\ninfinite patience; this is not to mention that despite supposed\r\ncompatibility, I have not *ever* succeeded in getting the Animas\r\nezManager software to sync with the pump successfully on my iMac running\r\nOS X 10.7 Lion or 10.8 Mountain Lion); many devices and applications keep the data they produce locked away in\r\nproprietary formats or only offer exporting of data in formats\r\ninconvenient or downright useless (e.g., XML) for the average user.\r\n\r\nIn recent years since the introduction of the iPhone and the rising to\r\ndominance of the smart phone paradigm in the cell phone marketplace, a\r\nwhole host of \"logbook\" applications have been developed ostensibly to\r\nmake the management of diabetes-related data easier. However, nearly\r\nall - if not all (I speak from the position of having casually but not\r\nthoroughly surveyed the landscape) - of these applications continue to\r\nrequire a PWD to manually enter the data s/he wants to track. Given the\r\nfact that except on the most very basic of blood glucose meters, every\r\ntest performed on a blood glucose meter is stored in memory, this\r\nstrikes me as a completely unnecessary replication of effort. The act of\r\nperforming a blood glucose test is itself an act of record-making; to\r\nrequire that the PWD take the extra step of entering the result of this\r\ntest into a data-tracking application is *silly* and *wasteful*. The\r\nsame goes for insulin doses and carbohydrate counts, at least where insulin pumps with \"Bolus Wizard\"-type functionality are involved.\r\n\r\n## My Solution\r\n\r\nAll of this is an introduction to the tools I'm developing in this\r\nrepository. The tools here all rely on the export formats that *are*\r\navailable from various diabetes devices. (At the moment, of course, this\r\nis limited to the devices I personally use.) My goal is to create\r\nsoftware tools that will be truly cross-platform, freely available (and\r\nopen source), and easy to use. The goal of these tools is to integrate\r\ndata regarding all aspects of life that affect diabetes (including\r\nmeals, carbohydrate counts, exercise, sleep, etc., as well as blood\r\nglucose readings and insulin doses) and present that data in engaging,\r\ninformative, and in appropriate cases interactive visualizations.\r\n\r\nIf you would like to be involved in testing these software tools, you\r\nmay contact me via e-mail. Be aware that in their present state, the\r\ntools I've developed are **not yet user-friendly**: you need to be\r\nfamiliar with the command line in order to use these tools.\r\n\r\n* * * * *\r\n\r\nCopyright 2013 Jana E.
